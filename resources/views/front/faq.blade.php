                            <li>They are asking for a longer tenancy agreement than you are comfortable with.</li>
                            <li>They are evasive about their employment or financial situation.</li>
                            <li>They have a history of criminal activity.</li>

                <h5>How can I avoid dodgy tenants?</h5>
                <p class="mb-4">There are a number of things that landlords can do to avoid dodgy tenants. These include:</p> 
                <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-4">
                    <div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do your research. Before renting out a property, landlords should do their research on potential tenants. This includes checking their credit history, employment history, and references.</li>
                            <li>Use a tenancy agreement. A tenancy agreement is a legal document that sets out the terms of the tenancy. It should include details such as the rent amount, the length of the tenancy, and the responsibilities of both the landlord and the tenant.</li>
                            <li>Take security deposits. A security deposit is a sum of money that is paid by the tenant to the landlord at the start of the tenancy. It is held by the landlord as a guarantee against any damage that the tenant may cause to the property.</li>
                            <li>Be clear about the rules. Landlords should be clear with their tenants about the rules of the property. This includes things such as noise levels, parking, and pets.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h5>What can I do if I have a dodgy tenant?</h5>
                <p class="mb-4">If a landlord does end up with a dodgy tenant, there are a number of things that they can do. These include:</p> 
                <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-4">
                    <div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Talk to the tenant. In some cases, a simple conversation with the tenant may be enough to resolve the problem.</li>
                            <li>Give the tenant a warning. If the tenant's behavior does not improve, the landlord may need to give them a warning. This should be in writing and should outline the consequences of further breaches of the tenancy agreement.</li>
                            <li>Evict the tenant. If the tenant's behavior is serious or if they have broken the terms of their tenancy agreement, the landlord may need to evict them. This is a legal process, and the landlord will need to follow the correct procedures.</li>

                <h5>What are the legal rights of landlords?</h5>
                <p class="mb-4">The legal rights of landlords in the UK vary depending on the type of tenancy agreement in place. However, there are some general principles that apply in most cases.
                </p> 
                <div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Right to receive rent on time: Landlords have the right to receive rent on time and in full. If a tenant fails to pay rent, the landlord may be able to take legal action to evict them.</li>
                            <li>Right to enter the property for reasonable purposes: Landlords have the right to enter the property for reasonable purposes, such as to carry out repairs or show the property to potential tenants. However, landlords must give the tenant reasonable notice before entering the property.</li>
                            <li>Right to evict tenants: Landlords have the right to evict tenants if they breach the terms of their tenancy agreement. However, there are strict rules around evictions, and landlords must follow the correct procedures.</li>
                            <li>Right to compensation for damage: If a tenant damages the property, the landlord may be able to claim compensation from the tenant.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
            </div>

            <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12">
                
                <p class="mb-4">In addition to these general principles, there are also a number of specific rights that landlords have in the UK. For example, landlords have the right to:</p> 
                <div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Set the rent: Landlords have the right to set the rent for their property, subject to certain restrictions.</li>
                            <li>Choose tenants: Landlords have the right to choose who they rent their property to, subject to certain restrictions.</li>
                            <li>Require tenants to have a deposit: Landlords have the right to require tenants to pay a deposit before they move into the property. This deposit can be used to cover any unpaid rent or damage to the property.</li>

                        </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12">

                <p class="mb-4">If you are a landlord in the UK, it is important to understand your legal rights.
