                            <li>To provide a forum for landlords to share their experiences and advice. Landlording can be a challenging and rewarding experience, but it can also be isolating. Landlord support groups provide a forum for landlords to connect with each other and share their experiences, both good and bad. This can be helpful for landlords who are new to the industry or who are facing challenges with their tenants.</li>
                            <li>To help landlords stay up-to-date on the latest laws and regulations. The laws and regulations governing landlord-tenant relations are constantly changing. Landlord support groups can help landlords stay up-to-date on the latest changes so that they can comply with the law and protect their interests.</li>
                            <li>To provide support and advice to landlords who are facing difficult situations. Landlording can be a stressful profession, and there will be times when landlords need support. Landlord support groups can provide support and advice to landlords who are facing difficult situations, such as tenants who are not paying rent or who are damaging the property.</li>
                            <li>To advocate for the rights of landlords. Landlords often have their rights overlooked or violated. Landlord support groups can advocate for the rights of landlords and help to ensure that they are treated fairly.</li>
