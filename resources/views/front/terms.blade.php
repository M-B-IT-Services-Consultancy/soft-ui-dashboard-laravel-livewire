                <p class="mb-4"><a class="text-danger">Dodgyone.com</a> believes that everyone has the power to shape and improve the world. We do this by providing a powerful, open-to-all review platform where landlords or reviewers can share their experiences with doggy tenants, and help other landlords before they re-let their property to dodgy ones.

                <p class="mb-4">This is because we want to ensure that all reviews on dodgyone.com are genuine and unbiased. We believe that the best way to get accurate information about a business is to hear from people who have had real experiences with it. If people are incentivized to write positive reviews, it can distort the overall picture and make it difficult for people to make informed decisions.</p>
